The file Analyse_noLepton_1invfb_mSUGRA.txt give for each point of the mSUGRA parameter space:

(fixed are Sigmmu = +1, TanBeta = 10, A0 = 0 GeV)

 m_0     m_1/2     m_~q       m_~g           2jets            3jets                 4jets

The 2/3/4jets are related to the analysis, where the number of jets differs according to the abundance of squarks/gluinos in the production
