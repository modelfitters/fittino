2013-07-11
	:General
	- removed unused variables in matrix element (eliminate compiler warnings)
	- removed unused functions from code
	- included uncertainty propagation due to Monte Carlo Integration
	- Functions return chisq-Value of Integrator (In case there are several integrations
	  the value with the largest deviation from 1 is returned)
	- two header files sminputs.h and effinputs.h combined to inputs.h, inputs.h, provides
	  a function to update the effective inputs (couplings) after coefficients have been set

	:Decay
	- Included Calculation of total width in the effective framework

	:VBF
	- Functions to calculate VBF Cross Section in the 2,4 and 5 flavor scheme, normalized
	  on the corresponding Standard Model Cross Section

	:HadronicCS
	- Functions return ratio to SM Values

2013-07-12
