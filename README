1. Installation
---------------

- Untar the Fittino source code tarball with the command

  tar xvjf fittino-x.y.z.tar.bz2

- In order to compile Fittino, a C++ compiler like g++, make,
  a lexical analyzer generator like flex, a parser generator
  like bison and the ROOT data analysis framework are required.
  In addition to Fittino the SUSY spectrum calculator SPheno is
  required. Links to sites where these packages can be downloaded
  are provided on the Fittino web page http://www-flc.desy.de/fittino
  (click on "Source Code"). If these prerequisites are fulfilled
  just type

  cd fittino
  make

- If the compilation is successful, an executable file called
  "fittino" is produced.


2. Example Run
--------------

- Example input files are provided in the "inputs" directory
  of the Fittino distribution. DO NOT FORGET TO MODIFY THE
  "Calculator" VARIABLE IN THE INPUT FILE TO POINT TO YOUR
  SPHENO EXECUTABLE. With the example file "fittino.in.shortexample"
  the result of a short toy fit should be obtained within a few
  minutes.

- Input files are provided to Fittino as program parameter.
  Thus Fittino can be started with

  ./fittino inputs/fittino.in.shortexample


3. Running with SoftSUSY/SUSYHIT
--------------------------------

- Get SoftSUSY (http://projects.hepforge.org/softsusy/) and SUSYHIT (http://lappweb.in2p3.fr/~muehlleitner/SUSY-HIT/)

- Set "Calculator" to SOFTSUSY in the inputfile with the respective path
- Set "DecayCalculator" to SUSYHIT in the inputfile with the respective path

- GMSB and mSUGRA should work without any modifications to SoftSUSY or SUSYHIT
- AMSB fits will require a change in SoftSUSY, as it seems. MSSM doesnt work yet.
