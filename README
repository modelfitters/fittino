1. Requirements
---------------

- The following external programs/libraries are mandatory in order to compile
  Fittino

  Boost  (http://www.boost.org)
  ROOT   (http://root.cern.ch/drupal)
  slhaea (http://fthomas.github.com/slhaea)

2. Installation
---------------

- Change to the build directory

  cd build

- In order to configure cmake type

  cmake ..

  If this fails, it is most likly due to a library which is needed by Fittino
  (see Requirements) but not found by cmake. In this case edit CMakeLists.txt
  in the Fittino main directory to set the locations of the required libraries
  manually

- To build Fittino type

  make

- If the compilation is successful an executable called "fittino" is produced in
  build/sources/kernel
